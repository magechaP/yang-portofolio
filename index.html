      <h2>PROJECTS DONE</h2>
        <ul>
          <li ><a href="https://github.com/magechaP/Tritracker.github.io">Triangle Tracker</a></li>
           <p>The project entails a website which takes number values inputted and determines which type of triangle can or can't be formed from the values.It then alerts the user of the type of triangle formed.</p>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/magechaP/Quiz-Board"></a>Quiz Board</li>
            <p>This is a website used to test one's knowledge about javascript.Arguably one of my best projects,it contains questions which users answer and when they hit the submit answers button,they get answers,instantenously!</p>
           <li><a href="https://github.com/magechaP/Pig-dice"></a>Pig Dice</li>
             <p>Pig Dice is a famous game which is played with dice...and my website does just that.Don't get excited though,there are no real dice!.It was one of my most challenging project and it really helped me realise i had a potential</p>
         </ul>

         <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>My current level of education is quite low...i just finished highschool so I don't have a job experience yet but that wont be a bother soon.I decided to take programming classes because to me programming is my window of opportunities to the outside world.I believe i will be able to impact change to the world through programming.</p>

          <p>my current interest is code.I breathe,live,eat,sleep and see code,all day,everyday!My hobbies are reading novels.When i'm not reading you'll catch me visiting new places,probably with a novel in hand...hehehe.All my skills have evrything to do with music.I can dance,sing(though don't ask me to,i will croak) and i also mix(yeah,i'm a DJ).I also crack alot of jokes, and they are many.Be it vulgar,kinky,corny,sarcarstic or disses(I bite,but only when provoked hah!).</p>
